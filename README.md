Project Overview
This project explores how classical time series models—ARIMA and Holt’s Linear Trend—can be applied to forecast national unemployment rates. Using annual data from the World Bank spanning from 1991 to 2021, the study evaluates the performance of these models across five countries: India, United States, Germany, Brazil, and South Africa. The objective is to assess the predictive accuracy and practical applicability of the models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Research Objectives
To preprocess and structure the unemployment dataset for time series modeling.

To perform exploratory data analysis on trends, volatility, and anomalies in unemployment rates.

To apply ARIMA and Holt’s Linear Trend models for forecasting unemployment from 2022 to 2026.

To evaluate model performance using MAE and RMSE.

To compare model accuracy across countries with different economic profiles.

How to Run the Project
Download or clone the repository from GitHub.

Open the file Final_Unemployment_Forecasting.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

Ensure the dataset file unemployment analysis.csv is in the same directory.

Execute each cell in sequence to load, clean, analyze, forecast, and evaluate the data.

Forecast results for the years 2022–2026 will be generated and visualized.
